To update the site, edit one of the following files:

- _site.yml   --- this file controls the overall title and navigation
- index.Rmd   --- this file controls the main landing page
- team.Rmd    --- this file has all the individual people biographies
- footer.html --- this file has the copyright footer for all pages

In addition to those files, you may also want to add or change images
that are included. Right now, the only image is the flyer:
CLASS_Flyer_29022019_image.png. That can be updated and/or new images
added. Just move them into the top level directory and link in the
.Rmd files as needed.

Do **not** edit any files in the docs folder. These are automatically
generated by R.

To updated the website, after editing the files:

1. Start R
2. load the Rmarkdown package `library(rmarkdown)` if not installed,
install it
3. run: `render_site()`.
4. Stage, commit, and merge into master on Git.

That's it!
