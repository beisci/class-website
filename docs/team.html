<h2>Professor Shanthakumar Wilson Rajaratnam</h2>
<p><a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/shanthakumar-wilson-rajaratnam">Prof. Rajaratnam</a> is the principal investigator of the CLASS study. His research program aims to investigate the role of the internal biological clock in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, and how disruption of the clock leads to sleep disorders and other physiological consequences (for example, in shift workers). His group develops novel treatment approaches for sleep disorders that are caused by biological clock disruption. These include light and melatonin treatments. He is also investigating the contribution of sleep disturbances and fatigue to mood disorders and impaired cognition in clinical populations.</p>

<div id="dr.-bei-bei" class="section level2">
<h2>Dr. Bei Bei</h2>
<p><a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bei-bei">Dr. Bei</a> is a chief investigator on the CLASS study. She is a Clinical Psychologist and sleep researcher. She is interested the individual differences in sleep-wake behaviours, the relationship between sleep and mental health, and psychological interventions for better sleep. Her clinical work has focused on mood, anxiety, and sleep disorders in adult, adolescent, and perinatal populations.</p>

<div id="associate-professor-sean-cain" class="section level2">
<h2>Associate Professor Sean Cain</h2>
<p><a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/sean-cain">A/Prof. Cain</a> is a collaborator on the CLASS study. His research interests include sex differences in circadian rhythms and sleep, rhythms in cognitive performance, the neurobiology of nonphotic input to the biological clock, and the effect of aging on circadian function and cognition. Currently, he is examining circadian rhythms and sleep in human subjects. His primary focus is the examination of the relative influences of the circadian clock and sleep-wake homeotstat on cognitive function. This work involves examining how acute and chronic sleep loss affects different aspects of cognition across the 24-hour biological day. His work also focuses on sex differences in circadian rhythms and sleep. He has recently found that the habitual sleep of women is advanced, relative to men. This advanced timing may make women more vulnerable sleep disruption and insomnia.</p>

<div id="professor-mary-carskadon" class="section level2">
<h2>Professor Mary Carskadon</h2>
<p><a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mcarskad">Prof. Carskadon</a> is an international investigator on the CLASS study. Prof. Carskadon’s current research includes an evaluation of how sleep and circadian timing influence smell, taste, food choices, and food consumption in overweight and normal weight teens and development of â€œsmart lightingâ€ to improve academic outcomes in secondary school students. Her team is also investigating the impact of serial nights of alcohol use in adults on sleep and next-day cognitive performance. Proposed new projects seek to (1) perform field and laboratory studies of caffeine’s effect on sleep and circadian phase in early adolescence; (2) measure DNA methylation and genotype with observational phenotyping and experimental interventions in young adults and test genes identified in a model organism, C. elegans; and (3) measure sleep and asthma disparities in urban children; (4) examine the role of sleep and circadian timing of salivary amylase in food choices; (5) assess how sleep duration impacts immune balance in inner-city children with asthma; (6) evaluate methods to deliver smart-lighting to improve wellness in older adults.</p>

<h2>Associate Professor Elizabeth B. Klerman</h2>
<p><a href="https://sleep.med.harvard.edu/people/faculty/225/Elizabeth+B+Klerman+MD+PhD">A/Prof. Klerman</a> is an international investigator on the CLASS study. Her current research focuses on the areas of: (1) the interaction of endocrine, circadian and sleep rhythms in normal and pathological states (2) mathematical modeling of sleep, circadian system and markers of its function. Dr. Klerman is Director of the Analytic Modeling Unit within the Division of Sleep Medicine at BWH. She collaborates with investigators from other Divisions to apply the principles of circadian rhythms research to the study of human physiology and pathophysiology. Members of the Analytic and Modeling Unit systematically and mathematically explore many aspects of the sleep and circadian rhythms. The results have implications for the design and analysis of future circadian experiments as well as reinterpretation of earlier studies. This work is part of a cycle of experimental work- mathematical modeling and predictions- experimental work.</p>

<h2>Associate Professor Steven W. Lockley</h2>
<p><a href="https://sleep.med.harvard.edu/people/faculty/163/Steven+W+Lockley+PhD">A/Prof. Lockley</a> is an international investigator on the CLASS study. The Circadian Physiology Program focuses on basic and applied aspects of human circadian biology. Their translational approach includes use of a range of techniques including epidemiology, field-based physiological studies and inpatient intensive physiological monitoring. They have a particular interest in human circadian photoreception and the effects of light on the circadian pacemaker and other non-image forming responses. Their studies include investigations of the effects of timing, duration, intensity and wavelength of light exposure on circadian resetting, melatonin suppression and the acute alerting effects of light. They also study visually impaired individuals under field and laboratory conditions to examine the effects of the severity and type of blindness on circadian photoreception, the periodicity of the circadian pacemaker and development of circadian rhythm sleep disorders. These basic studies have led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat non-24-hour sleep wake disorder, Advanced- and Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome with appropriately-timed melatonin administration in blind patients. They have also recently begun to examine the role of visual impairment on endocrinology and breast cancer risk in blind women.</p>

<h2>Dr. Andrew Phillips</h2>
<p><a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/andrew-phillips">Dr. Phillips</a> is a collaborator on the CLASS study. Dr. Phillips is a Senior Lecturer within the Monash Institute of Cognitive and Clinical Neurosciences in the School of Psychological Sciences. His research vision is to understand the biology, behaviour, and functions of sleep and circadian rhythms through physiologically based modelling. He has developed mathematical models and health-based metrics that are widely used in the sleep and circadian fields. His work is closely integrated with experiments, so that model predictions can be tested and so that additional insights can be gleaned from data.</p>
